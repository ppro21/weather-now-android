# weather-now-android

This is an Android weather application written in Kotlin. I built this app for practicing using Android Jetpack frame work and generally suggested android architectural patterns.
I followed the MVVM pattern to help maintain separation of the 3 main layers that make up an application - View, Model, Data/Network.
